I am a doctoral student at Michigan State University in the [Geospatial Lab](http://blue.for.msu.edu/) of Dr. Andrew Finley. My research interests lie in the development of Bayesian hierarchical models for environmental monitoring and decision making. I am currently focusing on developing Bayesian models to answer questions in the field of environmental acoustics.
