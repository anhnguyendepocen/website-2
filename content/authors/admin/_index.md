I am a graduate student at Michigan State University in the [Geospatial Lab](http://blue.for.msu.edu/) of Dr. Andrew Finley. My research interests lie in the development of Bayesian hierarchical models for environmental monitoring and decision making. More specifically, I am interested in the development and application of statistical models for methods of monitoring wildlife populations across large spatio-temporal regions, including citizen science data and acoustic recordings.
