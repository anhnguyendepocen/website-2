The [Northeast Temperate Inventory and Monitoring Network (NETN)](https://www.nps.gov/im/netn/breeding-landbirds.htm) of the National Park Service (NPS) consists of 13 parks in the Northeastern United States. As breeding landbirds are important components of park ecosystems and are very popular among park visitors, the NETN has implmented a volunteer-based breeding landbird monitoring program over the last 13 years to provide insight on the trends of the avian communities in each of these parks. Volunteer birders collect data using traditional point-count surveys, where they mark each bird they observe, estimate how far they are from the bird, and record the time of the first sighting of each individual bird. Because this is a volunteer based survey, we require a protocol that is not too labor intensive for the volunteers, while also enabling estimation of population trends of important species of interest. The NETN protocol enables estimation of avian abundance and trends over time through the use of removal sampling and distance sampling models to account for each observer not detecting every bird present at a given point count location. However, it is likely that a model using information from both sampling protocols within a dynamic Markov modeling framework will improve inference and estimation of avian population trends. We are currently in development of a dynamic, multispecies hierarchical model that uses data regarding the distance of an individual bird to the observer and the timing of first detection of an individual bird to improve inference on trends in avian species abundance over time. Specifically, we seek to

1. Determine the rate of change in abundance of important avian species of interest in each NETN park.
2. Display how using a combined distance sampling and removal sampling approach in a single, multi-species dynamic model can improve inference on the estimated rate of change of different avian species of interest compared to using each modeling protocol separately. 
3. Determine the influence of silvicultural practices and habitat variables on avian abundance.
