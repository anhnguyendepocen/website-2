Assessing the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on wildlife and natural resources is a necessary conservation task. The soundscape is an important natural resource for acoustically communicating organisms as well as humans, but the use of the soundscape as a tool for assessing disturbance impacts has been relatively unexplored until recently. We are currently developing a broad modeling framework for assessing disturbance impacts on soundscapes, which we apply to describe the influence of a selection logging on soundscapes in northern Michigan to answer the following questions: 

1. What is the impact of the selection logging on the soundscape? 
2. How has the composition of the soundscape changed as a result of the logging? 
3. What do answers to the above questions suggest about the impact of the selection logging on avian diversity?

Recordings were obtained at 13 total sites before and after a selection logging. Four sites were in the logging region and nine sites served as control recordings outside of the logging region. We quantify the soundscapes using common acoustic indices (Normalized Difference Soundscape Index NDSI), Acoustic Entropy (H), Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), Acoustic Evenness Index (AEI), Welch Power Spectral Density (PSD)) and build two hierarchical Bayesian models to describe the changes in the soundscape over the study period. The approach accommodates inherent differences in control and treatment sites to improve reliability of the estimated treatment effects, while also accounting for extraneous variables (i.e. rain) that influence acoustic indices.
