      <description>The use of acoustic data in ecological and environmental studies has seen a dramatic increase over the last 20 years with the growth of the fields of ecoacoustics and soundscape ecology. This has largely been the result of technological developments enabling researchers to purchase large amounts of relatively inexpensive autonomous acoustic recording units. While ecoacoustics and soundscape ecology are rapidly expanding to help inform our understanding of how organisms use the acoustic environment and how this relationship is influenced by anthropogenic activities, the development of occupancy modeling techniques for acoustic data is still in it&amp;rsquo;s infancy.</description>
