I am currently analyzing a soundscape data set collected by Stuart Gage. The data consist of recordings that occur at 13 sites in the Twin Lakes, Michigan area. Four of these sites were exposed to a selective logging in 2014. Recordings were obtained prior to and after the recording. I seek to answer the following questions:

1. What was the immediate impact of a selective logging on the dawn chorus soundscapes? 
2. What is the long-term impact of the selective logging on the soundscapes? Have the soundscapes been able to recover to their original diversity prior to the logging?
3. How has the composition of the soundscapes changed as a result of the logging? Are certain frequencies more dominant in soundscapes after the logging than before?
