# Scripts, R Markdown, and Reproducible Research

Doing work in data science, whether for homework, a project for a business, or a research project, typically involves several iterations. For example, creating an effective graphical representation of data can involve trying out several different graphical representations, and then tens if not hundreds of iterations when fine-tuning the chosen representation. And each of these representations may require several R commands to create. Although this all could be accomplished by typing and re-typing commands at the R Console, it is easier and more effective to write the commands in a *script file* that can then be submitted to the R console either a line at a time or all together.^[Unsurprisingly it is also possible to submit several selected lines of code at once.] 

In addition to making the workflow more efficient, R scripts provide another large benefit. Often we work on one part of a homework assignment or project for a few hours, then move on to something else, and then return to the original part a few days, months, or sometimes even years later. In such cases we may have forgotten how we created a graphical display that we were so proud of, and will again need to spend a few hours to recreate it. If we save a script file, we have the ingredients immediately available when we return to a portion of a project.^[In principle the R history mechanism provides a similar record. But with history we have to search through a lot of other code to find what we're looking for, and scripts are a much cleaner mechanism to record our work.]

Next consider a larger scientific endeavor. Ideally a scientific study will be reproducible, meaning that an independent group of researchers (or the original researchers) will able to duplicate the study. Thinking about data science, this means that all the steps taken when working with the data from a study should be reproducible, from selection of variables to formal data analysis. In principle this can be facilitated by explaining, in words, each step of the work with data. In practice, on the other hand, it is typically difficult or impossible to reproduce a full data analysis based on a written explanation. It is much more effective to include the actual computer code that accomplished the data work in the report, whether the report is a homework assignment or a research paper. Tools in R such as *R Markdown* facilitate this process.

## Scripts in R

As noted above, scripts help to make working with data more efficient and provide a record of how data were managed and analyzed. Here we describe an example using the FEF data.^[The example uses features of R that we have not yet discussed, so don't worry about the details but rather about how it motivates the use of a script file.] First we read the FEF data into R using the code below.
```{r, prompt=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
face.dat <- read.csv(
    file="http://blue.for.msu.edu/FOR472/data/FACE_aspen_core_growth.csv"
)
```

Next we print the names of the variables in the data set. Don't be concerned about the specific details. Later we will learn much more about reading in data and working with data sets in R.

```{r, prompt = TRUE}
names(face.dat)
```

Let's create a scatter plot of 2008 DBH versus height. To do this we'll first create variables for DBH and height taken in the year 2008 and print out the first ten values of each variable.^[Neither of these steps are necessary, but are convenient for illustration.]

```{r, prompt=TRUE}
dbh <- face.dat$X2008_DBH
ht <- face.dat$X2008_Height
dbh[1:10]
ht[1:10]
```

The `NA` is how missing data are represented in R. Their presence here suggests several trees in this data set are dead or not measured for some reason in 2008.  Of course at some point it would be good to investigate which trees have missing data and why. The `plot()` function in R will omit missing values, and for now we will just plot the non-missing data. A scatter plot of the data is drawn next.

```{r, prompt=TRUE, fig.align="center"}
plot(dbh, ht)
```

Not surprisingly, the scatter plot shows that DBH and height are positively correlated and the relationship is nonlinear. Now that we have a basic scatter plot, it is tempting to make it more informative. We will do this by adding a feature that identifies which trees belong to the control and elevated CO$_2$ environment treatments. We do this by first separating DBH and height into their respective treatment groups.
```{r prompt = TRUE}
treat <- face.dat$Treat
dbh.treat.1 <- dbh[treat==1] ##Treatment 1 is the control
ht.treat.1 <- ht[treat==1]

dbh.treat.2 <- dbh[treat==2] ##Treatment 2 is the elevated CO2
ht.treat.2 <- ht[treat==2]
```

To make a more informative scatter plot we will do two things. First make a plot for treatment 1 data, but ensure the plot region is large enough to include the treatment 2 data. This is done by specifying the range of the plot axes via `xlim` and `ylim` arguments in the `plot()` function. Here the `xlim` and `ylim` are set to the range of `dbh` and `ht` values, respectively, using `range()` (try and figure out what the `na.rm` argument does in the range function). Second we add treatment 2 data via the `points()` function. There are several other arguments passed to the plot function, but don't worry about these details for now. 

<!-- These and many other plot considerations will be covered later in the text---we will learn about an R package called `ggplot2` that provides a simpler way to create such plots. -->
 
```{r, prompt=TRUE, fig.align= "center"}
plot(dbh.treat.1, ht.treat.1, xlim=range(dbh, na.rm=TRUE), 
     ylim=range(ht, na.rm=TRUE), pch=19, col="salmon3", cex=0.5, 
     xlab="DBH (cm)", ylab="Height (cm)")
points(dbh.treat.2, ht.treat.2, pch=19, col="blue", cex=0.5)
```

Of course we should have a plot legend to tell the viewer which colors are associated with the treatments, as well as many other aesthetic refinements. For now, however, we will resist such temptations.^[As an aside, by only looking at the plotted data and thinking about basic plant physiology, can you guess which color is associated with the elevated CO$_2$ treatment?]

Some of the process leading to the completed plot is shown above. We read in the data, created an intermediate plot by adding treatment identifiers, creating variables representing the 2008 measurements of DBH and height, and so on. However, a lot of the process isn't shown. For example, I made several mistakes in the process of getting the code and plot the way I wanted it---forgot the `na.rm=TRUE` initially then fiddled around with the treatment colors a bit.

Now imagine trying to recreate the plot a few days later. Possibly someone saw the plot and commented that it would be interesting to see similar plots for each year in the study period. If we did all the work, including all the false starts and refinements, at the console it would be hard to sort things out. This would take much longer than necessary to create the new plots. This would be especially true if a few months had passed, rather than just a few days.

Creating the new scatter plots would be much easier with a script file, especially if it had a few well-chosen comments. Fortunately it is quite easy to create and work with script files in RStudio.^[It is also easy in R without RStudio. Just use `File > New script` to create a script file, and save it before exiting R.] Just choose `File > New File > New script` and a script window will open up in the upper left of the full RStudio window. 

An example of a script window (with some R code already typed in) is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:script). From the script window the user can, among other things, save the script (either using the `File` menu or the icon near the top left of the window) and can run one or more lines of code from the window (using the `run` icon in the window, or by copying and pasting into the console window). In addition, there is a `Source on Save` checkbox. If this is checked, the R code in the script window is automatically read into R and executed when the script file is saved.

```{r script, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "A script window in RStudio", out.width = '100%'}

```

## R Markdown

People typically work on data with a larger purpose in mind. Possibly the purpose is to understand a biological system more clearly. Possibly the purpose is to refine a system that recommends movies to users in an online streaming movie service. Possibly the purpose is to complete a homework assignment and demonstrate to the instructor an understanding of an aspect of data analysis. Whatever the purpose, a key aspect is communicating with the desired audience.

One possibility, which is somewhat effective, is to write a document using software such as Microsoft Word ^[Or possibly LaTeX if the document is more technical] and to include R output such as computations and graphics by cutting and pasting into the main document. One drawback to this approach is similar to what makes script files so useful: If the document must be revised it may be hard to unearth the R code that created graphics or analyses, to revise these.^[Organizing the R code using script files and keeping all the work organized in a well-thought-out directory structure can help here, but this requires a level of forethought and organization that most people do not possess $\ldots$ including myself.] A more subtle but possibly more important drawback is that the reader of the document will not know precisely how analyses were done, or how graphics were created. Over time even the author(s) of the paper will forget the details. A verbal description in a "methods" section of a paper can help here, but typically these do not provide all the details of the analysis, but rather might state something like, "All analyses were carried out using R version 3.3.1."

RStudio's website provides an excellent overview of R Markdown capabilities for reproducible research. At minimum, follow the `Get Started` link at http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ and watch the introduction video.

Among other things, R Markdown provides a way to include R code that read in data, create graphics, or perform analyses, all in a single document that is processed to create a research paper, homework assignment, or other written product. The R Markdown file is a plain text file containing text the author wants to show in the final document, simple commands to indicate how the text should be formatted (for example boldface, italic, or a bulleted list), and R code that creates output (including graphics) on the fly. Perhaps the simplest way to get started is to see an R Markdown file and the resulting document that is produced after the R Markdown document is processed. In Figure \@ref(fig:rmark) we show the input and output of an example R Markdown document. In this case the output created is an HTML file, but there are other possible output formats, such as Microsoft Word or PDF.

```{r rmark, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Example R Markdown Input and Output", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("03-scripts/03-images/rmarkdownInputOutput.png")
```

At the top of the input R Markdown file are some lines with `---` at the top and the bottom. These lines are not needed, but give a convenient way to specify the title, author, and date of the article that are then typeset prominently at the top of the output document. For now, don't be concerned with the lines following `output:`. These can be omitted (or included as shown).

Next are a few lines showing some of the ways that font effects such as italics, boldface, and strikethrough can be achieved. For example, an asterisk before and after text sets the text in *italics*, and two asterisks before and after text sets the text in **boldface**. 

More important for our purposes is the ability to include R code in the R Markdown file, which will be executed with the output appearing in the output document. Bits of R code included this way are called *code chunks*. The beginning of a code chunk is indicated with three backticks and an "r" in curly braces: ` ```{r}`. The end of a code chunk is indicated with three backticks ` ``` `. For example, the R Markdown file in Figure \@ref(fig:rmark) has one code chunk:

````r
`r ''````{r}
x = 1:10
y = 10:1
mean(x)
sd(y)
```
````

In this code chunk two vectors `x` and `y` are created, and the mean of `x` and the standard deviation of `y` are computed. In the output in Figure \@ref(fig:rmark) the R code is reproduced, and the output of the two lines of code asking for the mean and standard deviation is shown. 

### Creating and processing R Markdown documents

RStudio has features which facilitate creating and processing R Markdown documents. Choose `File > New File > R  Markdown...`. In the ensuing dialog box, make sure that `Document` is highlighted on the left, enter the title and author (if desired), and choose the Default Output Format (HTML is good to begin). Then click OK. A document will appear in the upper left of the RStudio window. It is an R Markdown document, and the title and author you chose will show up, delimited by `---` at the top of the document. A generic body of the document will also be included. 

For now just keep this generic document as is. To process it to create the HTML output, click the `Knit HTML` button at the top of the R Markdown window^[If you hover your mouse over this Knit button after a couple seconds it should display a keyboard shortcut for you to do this if you don't like pushing buttons]. You'll be prompted to choose a filename for the R Markdown file. Make sure that you use `.Rmd` as the extension for this file. Once you've successfully saved the file, RStudio will process the file, create the HTML output, and open this output in a new window. The HTML output file will also be saved to your working directory. This file can be shared with others, who can open it using a web browser such as Chrome or Firefox. 

There are many options which allow customization of R Markdown documents. Some of these affect formatting of text in the document, while others affect how R code is evaluated and displayed. The RStudio web site contains a useful summary of many R Markdown options at https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf. A different, but mind-numbingly busy, cheatsheet is at https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf. Some of the more commonly used R Markdown options are described next.

### Text: Lists and Headers
Unordered (sometimes called bulleted) lists and ordered lists are easy in R Markdown. Figure \@ref(fig:lists) illustrates the creation of unordered and ordered lists.

```{r lists, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Producing Lists in R Markdown", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("03-scripts/03-images/listsPic.png")
```

+ For an unordered list, either an asterisk, a plus sign, or a minus sign may precede list items. Use a space after these symbols before including the list text. To have second-level items (sub-lists) indent four spaces before indicating the list item. This can also be done for third-level items. 

+ For an ordered list use a numeral followed by a period and a space (1. or 2. or 3. or ...) to indicate a numbered list, and use a letter followed by a period and a space (a. or b. or c. or ...) to indicate a lettered list. The same four space convention used in unordered lists is used to designate ordered sub lists. 

+ For an ordered list, the first list item will be labeled with the number or letter that you specify, but subsequent list items will be numbered sequentially. The example in Figure \@ref(fig:lists) will make this more clear. In those examples notice that for the ordered list, although the first-level numbers given in the R Markdown file are 1, 2, and 17, the numbers printed in the output are 1, 2, and 3. Similarly the letters given in the R Markdown file are c and q, but the output file prints c and d. 

R Markdown does not give substantial control over font size. Different "header" levels are available that provide different font sizes. Put one or more hash marks in front of text to specify different header levels. Other font choices such as subscripts and superscripts are possible, by surrounding the text either by tildes or carets. More sophisticated mathematical displays are also possible, and are surrounded by dollar signs. The actual mathematical expressions are specified using a language called LaTeX  See Figures \@ref(fig:headers) and \@ref(fig:latex) for examples. 

```{r headers, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Headers and Some LaTeX in R Markdown", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("03-scripts/03-images/headersAndLatex.png")
```

```{r latex, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Other useful LaTeX symbols and expressions in R Markdown", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("03-scripts/03-images/latex.png")
```

### Code Chunks

R Markdown provides a large number of options to vary the behavior of code chunks. In some contexts it is useful to display the output but not the R code leading to the output. In some contexts it is useful to display the R prompt, while in others it is not. Maybe we want to change the size of figures created by graphics commands. And so on. A large number of code chunk options are described in http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf. 

Code chunk options are specified in the curly braces near the beginning of a code chunk. Below are a few of the more commonly used options are described.  The use of these options is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:chunk).

1. `echo=FALSE` specifies that the R code itself should not be printed, but any output of the R code should be printed in the resulting document. 

2. `include=FALSE` specifies that neither the R code nor the output should be printed. However, the objects created by the code chunk will be available for use in later code chunks. 

3. `eval=FALSE` specifies that the R code should not be evaluated. The code will be printed unless, for example, `echo=FALSE` is also given as an option.

4. `error=FALSE` and `warning=FALSE` specify that, respectively, error messages and warning messages generated by the R code should not be printed. 

5. The `comment` option allows a specified character string to be prepended to each line of results. By default this is set to `comment = '##'` which explains the two hash marks preceding the results in Figure \@ref(fig:rmark). Setting `comment = NA` presents output without any character string prepended. That is done in most code chunks in this book.

6. `prompt=TRUE` specifies that the R prompt `>` will be prepended to each line of R code shown in the document. `prompt = FALSE` specifies that command prompts should not be included.

7. `fig.height` and `fig.width` specify the height and width of figures generated by R code. These are specified in inches. For example, `fig.height=4` specifies a four inch high figure.

Figures \@ref(fig:chunk) gives examples of the use of code chunk options.


```{r chunk, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Output of Example R Markdown", fig.show = 'hold', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("03-scripts/03-images/chunks1.png", "03-scripts/03-images/chunks2.png"))
```


### Output formats other than HTML
It is possible to use R Markdown to produce documents in formats other than HTML, including Word and PDF documents. Next to the `Knit HTML` button is a down arrow. Click on this and choose `Knit Word` to produce a Microsoft word output document. Although there is also a `Knit PDF` button, PDF output requires additional software called TeX in addition to RStudio.^[It isn't particularly hard to install TeX software. For a Microsoft Windows system, MiKTeX is convenient and is available from https://miktex.org. For a Mac system, MacTeX is available from https://www.tug.org/mactex/] 

### LaTeX, knitr, and bookdown

While R Markdown provides substantial flexibility and power, it lacks features such as cross-referencing, fine control over fonts, etc. If this is desired, a variant of R Markdown called `knitr`, which has very similar syntax to R Markdown for code chunks, can be used in conjunction with the typesetting system LaTeX to produce documents. We originally created this book using knitr and LaTeX. For simpler tasks, however, R Markdown is sufficient, and substantially easier to learn.

As you know (since you are reading this) we are currently converting this book into R Markdown using the package `bookdown` written by Yihui Xie. This package utilizes the R Markdown style that is described above, and also incorporates numerous other features that R Markdown alone does not have (see the previous paragraph). Perhaps the best part about `bookdown` (in addition to it's lovely formatting style) is that we can make it interactive, so as you read the html version of this book you can interact with the code itself. You will experience this first hand when you work through the spatial data and databases chapters.
